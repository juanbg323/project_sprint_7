# project_sprint_7
this repo is for the project of the 7th sprint in triple ten's data science bootcamp

The purpose of this project is to develop a fully functional web application using the tools and concepts learned throughout this sprint. The process involves creating and managing a virtual environment from the command line, cloning a Git repository from GitHub, and building a Python-based application with Streamlit, pandas, and Plotly. Finally, the application will be deployed and hosted using the Render web service, allowing it to run online and be accessible to users.
